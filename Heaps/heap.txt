HEAPS:

heap hamara ek DS hai w/c is a complete binary tree and comes with heap order property

BT:
Each node can have at most 2 children (left and right).

CBT:
All levels are completely filled except possibly the last.
In the last level, nodes are filled from left to right (lean towards left).


HEAP ORDER PROPERTY:
MAX heap:
child node<parent node

MIN heap:
child node>parent node

INSERTION:

Node-> i;
lc-> 2*i;
rc-> 2*i+1;
p-> i/2;

Insertion Algorithm

Insert the element at the end (bottom-most, leftmost position).
Heapify Up → Compare with the parent and swap if the heap property is violated.
Continue until the correct position is found.

TC:
O(log n) — because height of a heap is log n.
